// instantiate ConvertToJS. The more generic specializations are found in node_ls2_utils.cpp, others

// to convert parameters passed in from JavaScript into their C++ equivelents.
// Conversion is done with a structure template, rather than a function template, so that we can take advantage of V8's
// String::Utf8Value() structure to convert v8 strings to const char* reference. String::Utf8Value
// cannot be copied, so we can't return it from a function.
